Book Recommendation Engine

This module provides AI-powered book recommendations using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model.
It analyzes a user's reading history and preferences to generate personalized
book suggestions that match their interests, writing style preferences, and
thematic inclinations.

The recommendations are generated using a conversational prompt that mimics
a knowledgeable librarian, ensuring suggestions are both relevant and
engagingly presented.
